              [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_format_inputs_to_chatgpt_models).

          model: ID of the model to use. See the
              [model endpoint compatibility](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/model-endpoint-compatibility)
              table for details on which models work with the Chat API.

          frequency_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their

          function_call: Deprecated in favor of `tool_choice`.

              Controls which (if any) function is called by the model. `none` means the model
              will not call a function and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model
              can pick between generating a message or calling a function. Specifying a
              particular function via `{"name": "my_function"}` forces the model to call that
              function.

              `none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default if
              functions are present.

          functions: Deprecated in favor of `tools`.

              A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.

          logit_bias: Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

              Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the
              tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the
              bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact
              effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or
              increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban
              or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

          logprobs: Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true,
              returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the `content` of
              `message`. This option is currently not available on the `gpt-4-vision-preview`
              model.

          max_tokens: The maximum number of [tokens](/tokenizer) that can be generated in the chat
              completion.

              The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's
              context length.
              [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken)
              for counting tokens.

          n: How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that
              you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the
              choices. Keep `n` as `1` to minimize costs.

          presence_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
              whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
              talk about new topics.

              [See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation/parameter-details)

          response_format: An object specifying the format that the model must output. Compatible with
              [GPT-4 Turbo](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4-and-gpt-4-turbo) and
              all GPT-3.5 Turbo models newer than `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.

              Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which guarantees the
              message the model generates is valid JSON.

              **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to
              produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may
              generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token
              limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that
              the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which
              indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the
              max context length.

          seed: This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to
              sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and
              parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you
              should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes
              in the backend.

          stop: Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.

          stream: If set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPT. Tokens will be
              sent as data-only
              [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format)
              as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]`
              message.
              [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_stream_completions).

          temperature: What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will
              make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more
              focused and deterministic.

              We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.

          tool_choice: Controls which (if any) function is called by the model. `none` means the model
              will not call a function and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model
              can pick between generating a message or calling a function. Specifying a
              particular function via
              `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to
              call that function.

              `none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default if
              functions are present.

          tools: A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a
              tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs
              for.

          top_logprobs: An integer between 0 and 5 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return
              at each token position, each with an associated log probability. `logprobs` must
              be set to `true` if this parameter is used.

          top_p: An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the
              model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1
              means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

              We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.

          user: A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor
              and detect abuse.
              [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices/end-user-ids).

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

              tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs

          top_logprobs: An integer between 0 and 5 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return
              at each token position, each with an associated log probability. `logprobs` must
              be set to `true` if this parameter is used.

          top_p: An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the
              model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1
              means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

              [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_format_inputs_to_chatgpt_models).

          model: ID of the model to use. See the

          function_call: Deprecated in favor of `tool_choice`.

              Controls which (if any) function is called by the model. `none` means the model
              will not call a function and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model
              can pick between generating a message or calling a function. Specifying a
              particular function via `{"name": "my_function"}` forces the model to call that
              function.

              `none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default if
              functions are present.

          functions: Deprecated in favor of `tools`.

              A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.

          logit_bias: Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

              Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the
              tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the
              bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact
              effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or
              increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban
              or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

          logprobs: Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true,
              returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the `content` of
              `message`. This option is currently not available on the `gpt-4-vision-preview`
              model.

          max_tokens: The maximum number of [tokens](/tokenizer) that can be generated in the chat
              completion.

              The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's
              context length.
              [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken)
              for counting tokens.

          n: How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that
              you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the
              choices. Keep `n` as `1` to minimize costs.

          presence_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
              whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
              talk about new topics.

              [See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation/parameter-details)

          response_format: An object specifying the format that the model must output. Compatible with
              [GPT-4 Turbo](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4-and-gpt-4-turbo) and
              all GPT-3.5 Turbo models newer than `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.

              Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which guarantees the
              message the model generates is valid JSON.

              **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to
              produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may
              generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token
              limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that
              the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which
              indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the
              max context length.

          seed: This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to
              sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and
              parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you
              should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes
              in the backend.

          stop: Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.

          temperature: What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will
              make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more
              focused and deterministic.

              We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.

          tool_choice: Controls which (if any) function is called by the model. `none` means the model
              will not call a function and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model
              can pick between generating a message or calling a function. Specifying a
              particular function via
              `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to
              call that function.

              `none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default if
              functions are present.

          tools: A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a
              tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs

          function_call: Deprecated in favor of `tool_choice`.

              Controls which (if any) function is called by the model. `none` means the model
              will not call a function and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model
              can pick between generating a message or calling a function. Specifying a
              particular function via `{"name": "my_function"}` forces the model to call that
              function.

              `none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default if
              functions are present.

          functions: Deprecated in favor of `tools`.

              A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.

          logit_bias: Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

              Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the
              tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the
              bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact
              effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or
              increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban
              or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

          logprobs: Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true,
              returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the `content` of
              `message`. This option is currently not available on the `gpt-4-vision-preview`
              model.

          max_tokens: The maximum number of [tokens](/tokenizer) that can be generated in the chat
              completion.

              The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's
              context length.
              [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken)
              for counting tokens.

          n: How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that
              you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the
              choices. Keep `n` as `1` to minimize costs.

          presence_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
              whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
              talk about new topics.

              [See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation/parameter-details)

          response_format: An object specifying the format that the model must output. Compatible with
              [GPT-4 Turbo](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4-and-gpt-4-turbo) and
              all GPT-3.5 Turbo models newer than `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.

              Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which guarantees the
              message the model generates is valid JSON.

              **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to
              produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may
              generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token
              limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that
              the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which
              indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the
              max context length.

          seed: This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to
              sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and
              parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you
              should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes
              in the backend.

          stop: Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.

          stream: If set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPT. Tokens will be
              sent as data-only
              [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format)
              as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]`
              message.
              [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_stream_completions).

          temperature: What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will
              make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more
              focused and deterministic.

              We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.

          tool_choice: Controls which (if any) function is called by the model. `none` means the model
              will not call a function and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model
              can pick between generating a message or calling a function. Specifying a
              particular function via
              `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to
              call that function.

              `none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default if
              functions are present.

          tools: A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a
              tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs
              for.

          top_logprobs: An integer between 0 and 5 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return
              at each token position, each with an associated log probability. `logprobs` must
              be set to `true` if this parameter is used.

          top_p: An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the
              model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1
              means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

              We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.

          user: A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor
              and detect abuse.
              [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices/end-user-ids).

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

              sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and
              parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you
              should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes
              in the backend.

          stop: Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.

          temperature: What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will
              make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more
              focused and deterministic.

              We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.

          tool_choice: Controls which (if any) function is called by the model. `none` means the model
              will not call a function and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model
              can pick between generating a message or calling a function. Specifying a
              particular function via
              `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to
              call that function.

              `none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default if
              functions are present.

          tools: A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a
              tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs
              for.

          top_logprobs: An integer between 0 and 5 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return
              at each token position, each with an associated log probability. `logprobs` must
              be set to `true` if this parameter is used.

          top_p: An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the
              model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1
              means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

              We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.

          user: A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor
              and detect abuse.

              [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_format_inputs_to_chatgpt_models).

          model: ID of the model to use. See the

              table for details on which models work with the Chat API.

          frequency_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their
              existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to
              repeat the same line verbatim.

          function_call: Deprecated in favor of `tool_choice`.

              Controls which (if any) function is called by the model. `none` means the model
              will not call a function and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model
              can pick between generating a message or calling a function. Specifying a
              particular function via `{"name": "my_function"}` forces the model to call that
              function.

              `none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default if
              functions are present.

          functions: Deprecated in favor of `tools`.

              A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.

          logit_bias: Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

              Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the
              tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the
              bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact
              effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or
              increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban
              or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

          logprobs: Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true,
              returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the `content` of
              `message`. This option is currently not available on the `gpt-4-vision-preview`
              model.

          max_tokens: The maximum number of [tokens](/tokenizer) that can be generated in the chat
              completion.

              The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's
              context length.
              [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken)
              for counting tokens.

          n: How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that
              you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the
              choices. Keep `n` as `1` to minimize costs.

          presence_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
              whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
              talk about new topics.

              [See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation/parameter-details)

          response_format: An object specifying the format that the model must output. Compatible with
              [GPT-4 Turbo](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4-and-gpt-4-turbo) and
              all GPT-3.5 Turbo models newer than `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.

              Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which guarantees the
              message the model generates is valid JSON.

              **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to
              produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may
              generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token
              limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that
              the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which
              indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the
              max context length.

          seed: This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to
              sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and
              parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you
              should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes
              in the backend.

          temperature: What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will
              make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more
              focused and deterministic.

        Args:
            messages (Iterable[ChatCompletionMessageParam]): A sequence of message objects that make up the
                conversation so far. Each message is a dictionary that should include the keys `role` and
                `content`, where `role` is either `user` or `assistant`, indicating who is speaking, and
                `content` is a string containing the message text. This parameter is essential for
                constructing the conversational context for the model's response.
            model (Union[str, Literal[...]]): The model ID of the OpenAI GPT model to use for generating the chat
                completion. This parameter specifies which version of the model to use, for example,
                `text-davinci-003` for general-purpose completions or `gpt-3.5-turbo` for optimized
                performance. The choice of model affects the quality, style, and capabilities of the
                generated content.
            stream (Optional[bool]): Whether the response should be streamed. Streaming can be useful for
                receiving responses as they are generated, especially for long completions. This approach
                enables real-time interaction and processing of the model's output.
            frequency_penalty (Optional[float]): Adjusts the likelihood of the model repeating the same line
                verbatim. Values can range from -2.0 to 2.0, with positive values making repeats less likely.
                This parameter helps in controlling the diversity of the generated text.
            function_call (Optional[FunctionCall]): Deprecated. Originally used to specify whether the model
                should execute a function call. While it is still accepted for backward compatibility, the
                `tool_choice` parameter is recommended for new implementations.
            functions (Optional[Iterable[Function]]): Deprecated. Originally provided a list of functions the
                model could choose to call during generation. Like `function_call`, this parameter has been
                superseded by `tools`.
            logit_bias (Optional[Dicst[str, int]]): Modifies token likelihood, mapping token IDs to bias values
                (-100 to 100), influencing selection. This mechanism allows for fine-tuning the presence or
                avoidance of specific words or phrases in the generated text.
            logprobs (Optional[bool]): Whether to return the log probabilities of the tokens generated in the
                completion. Useful for model introspection and understanding the model's decision-making
                process. Note: This feature might not be available for all models.
            max_tokens (Optional[int]): The maximum number of tokens to generate in the completion. This limit
                includes the tokens in the prompt. Careful management of this parameter is crucial for
                controlling the length and computational cost of model operations.
            n (Optional[int]): The number of completions to generate for each prompt. Higher values allow for
                more diversity in the responses but increase computational cost. Balancing this parameter
                is key to achieving desired output variability while managing resource use.
            presence_penalty (Optional[float]): Encourages new content by penalizing token presence, with values
                from -2.0 to 2.0. This parameter influences the model to explore new topics and ideas,
                enhancing the creativity and variability of the output.
            response_format (Optional[ResponseFormat]): Specifies how the model's responses should be formatted.
                For example, responses can be structured as plain text, JSON objects, or other formats
                depending on the model's capabilities. This flexibility allows for tailored outputs to suit
                different applications and processing needs.
            seed (Optional[int]): Seed for deterministic randomness, ensuring same inputs yield consistent
                outputs. This feature is beneficial for reproducibility and debugging purposes, allowing
                users to obtain the same results from identical requests.
            stop (Optional[Union[str, List[str]]]): Sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.
                This can be used to indicate the end of a message or section, providing a mechanism to
                control the scope and completion of the generated content.
            temperature (Optional[float]): Controls the randomness of the output. A lower temperature results in
                more deterministic output, while a higher temperature results in more diversity. Adjusting
                this parameter allows users to balance between predictability and creativity in the model's
                responses.
            tool_choice (Optional[ToolChoiceOptionParam]): Specifies which tool the model should use if it
                decides to make an external call. This replaces `function_call` and offers more granular
                control over the model's interactive capabilities.
            tools (Optional[Iterable[ToolParam]]): Lists tools available for response generation, including
                functions and APIs. This parameter expands the model's ability to incorporate external data
                and functionalities into its responses, broadening the scope of possible applications.
            top_logprobs (Optional[int]): Specifies the number of top logits to return, providing insight into
                the model's decision-making process. This information can be valuable for analyzing the
                model's preferences and the statistical distribution of its predictions.
            top_p (Optional[float]): Nucleus sampling strategy focusing on top P% probability mass, influencing
                token selection. This parameter adjusts the scope of the token set considered at each step,
                effectively adjusting the diversity and unpredictability of the output. A balance between
                coherence and variety can be achieved by tuning this parameter.
            user (Optional[str]): Identifies the end user of the API, aiding in monitoring usage patterns and
                detecting potential misuse. This parameter helps maintain the security and integrity of the
                system, ensuring that the API is used responsibly and in accordance with OpenAI's guidelines.

            extra_headers (Optional[Headers]): Additional HTTP headers to send with the request. This allows for
                customizing the request headers for scenarios that require specific HTTP header entries.
            extra_query (Optional[Query]): Extra query parameters for the request URL. These parameters are
                appended to the URL query string, providing a flexible way to extend the request with
                additional data.
            extra_body (Optional[Body]): Additional body parameters to include in the POST request. This can be
                used to pass extra information that is not covered by the standard parameters.
            timeout (Optional[float | httpx.Timeout]): Custom timeout for the request, overriding the default.
                Setting this parameter ensures that operations adhere to specific timing requirements,
                preventing excessively long waits or premature termination of requests.
