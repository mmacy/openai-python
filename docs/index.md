## About these docs

Though this documentation is officially unofficial, you're welcome to use and improve it until OpenAI brings up their own. (1)

1. For more information, see [Where is the documentation for the Python OpenAI SDK?](https://community.openai.com/t/where-is-the-documentation-for-the-python-openai-sdk/583643) in the OpenAI developer forum.

### Unofficial

**Neither this site nor its contents are officially endorsed by OpenAI.** Other than being a customer, I have no affiliation with OpenAI. I've published this documentation because I wanted full API reference for the Python library. You might find it useful, too.

You might instead prefer to use OpenAI's official docs on [OpenAI's official documentation site](https://platform.openai.com) and in the upstream [openai/openai-python](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) repository on GitHub, however.

### Unsupported

**The documentation on this site is provided AS-IS with NO WARRANTY.** The API reference is indeed generated from the OpenAI Python library's code, but I make no promises nor guarantee these docs reflect the current, past, or future state of the library.

That said, I use these docs myself and thus intend to keep them (mostly) current. However, there's no automation pulling content from their repo to this fork. (1)
