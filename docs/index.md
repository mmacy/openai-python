# About these docs

Welcome to Marsh's totally unofficial and totally unsupported documentation for the OpenAI Python library.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>
- :fontawesome-brands-python: [OpenAI Python library API reference][src.openai]
- :material-clock-fast: [Get started with the library](#get-started)
</div>

You can find official docs on [OpenAI's official documentation site](https://platform.openai.com) and in the upstream [openai/openai-python](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) repository on GitHub.

## Unofficial and unsupported

**Neither this site nor its contents are officially endorsed by OpenAI.** (1) Other than being a customer, I have no affiliation with OpenAI. I've published this documentation because I wanted full API reference for their Python library and figured you might find it useful, too.

1. They probably don't know this site exists. If OpenAI [publishes their own Python API reference](https://community.openai.com/t/where-is-the-documentation-for-the-python-openai-sdk/583643), I'll likely deactivate this site.

**The documentation on this site is provided AS-IS and with NO WARRANTY.** (1) I make no promises nor guarantee these docs reflect the current, past, or future state of OpenAI's Python library. That said, I use these docs myself and thus intend to keep them "mostly" current, but there's no automation pulling content from their repo to this fork.

1. This means you might encounter busted stuff or you might not find what you think should be here. In either case, you should refer to [openai/openai-python](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) as the source of truth.
