# About these docs

Welcome to Marsh's totally unofficial and totally unsupported documentation for the OpenAI Python library.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>
- :fontawesome-brands-python: [OpenAI Python library reference](openai.md)
- :material-clock-fast: [Get started with the library](./get_started.md)
</div>

## Unofficial

**Neither this site nor its contents are officially endorsed by OpenAI.** Other than being a customer, I have no affiliation with OpenAI. I've published this documentation because I wanted full API reference for the Python library. (1) You might find it useful, too.

1. I'll likely decommission this site when OpenAI [publishes their own Python API reference](https://community.openai.com/t/where-is-the-documentation-for-the-python-openai-sdk/583643).

You might instead prefer to use OpenAI's official docs on [OpenAI's official documentation site](https://platform.openai.com) and in the upstream [openai/openai-python](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) repository on GitHub, however.

## Unsupported

**The documentation on this site is provided AS-IS and with NO WARRANTY.** The API reference on this site is generated from the OpenAI Python library's code, but I make no promises nor guarantee these docs reflect the current, past, or future state of the library.

That said, I use these docs myself and thus intend to keep them (mostly) current, but there's no automation pulling content from their repo to this fork. (1)
{ .annotate }

1. This means you might encounter inaccuracies or you might not find what you think should be here. In either case, you should refer to [openai/openai-python](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) as the source of truth.
