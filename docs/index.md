# Welcome

Welcome to Marsh's totally unofficial and totally unsupported documentation for the OpenAI Python library.

## About these docs

These docs are officially unofficial and unsupported, but you're welcome to use and improve them until OpenAI brings up their own (1) or they ask me to take them down.

1. I'll likely decommission this site when OpenAI [publishes their own Python API reference](https://community.openai.com/t/where-is-the-documentation-for-the-python-openai-sdk/583643).

### Unofficial

**Neither this site nor its contents are officially endorsed by OpenAI.** Other than being a customer, I have no affiliation with OpenAI. I've published this documentation because I wanted full API reference for the Python library. You might find it useful, too.

You might instead prefer to use OpenAI's official docs on [OpenAI's official documentation site](https://platform.openai.com) and in the upstream [openai/openai-python](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) repository on GitHub, however.

### Unsupported

**The documentation on this site is provided AS-IS with NO WARRANTY.** The API reference is indeed generated from the OpenAI Python library's code, but I make no promises nor guarantee these docs reflect the current, past, or future state of the library.

That said, I use these docs myself and thus intend to keep them (mostly) current. However, there's no automation pulling content from their repo to this fork. (1)

1. That means you might encounter inaccuracies or you might not find what you think should be here. In either case, you should refer to [openai/openai-python](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) as the source of truth.
